;; Extensions to emacs buffer-selection library (bs.el)
;; This extension allows you to bind keys to buffer selection configurations (using `bs-ext-config-keys'),
;; and optionally displays the configuration names and associated keybindings in the header line of the
;; *buffer-selection* buffer.
;; It also creates a new config called "regexp". When the "/" key is pressed the user is prompted for a regular
;; expression and any buffers with matching names are added to the "regexp" config.
;;
;; The following new keybindings are defined:
;;
;; /        : prompt user for regular expression, place matching buffers in "regexp" config, and change to that config
;; <left>   : select previous config using `bs-ext-select-previous-configuration'
;; <right>  : select next config using `bs-select-next-configuration'
;; x        : kill buffer on current line using `bs-delete'

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put bs-ext.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'bs-ext)

;;; Customize:
;;
;;  bs-ext-show-configs-header : whether or not to show the configs header line
;;  bs-ext-config-keys : alist of keybindings and associated config names  
;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET bs RET
;;

;;; Change log:
